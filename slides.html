        ##Local development vs live websites
        
        Websites are built on computers. This is often referred to as developing *locally* since your site is only available on your computer. Also, all your website files are basically just a bunch of files (HTML pages, images, css files, etc) in a folder.
        
        To put that website online and make it live, all you need to do is move your *local* folders to a *server*, or *host*. 
        
        <br>
        **What is a server?**
        
        A server is a like a computer, but they never turn off and they are always connected to the internet. *Hosts* own many different servers and their job is to make sure the servers run properly, so that our websites are always available. 
      </script>
    </section>
    
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## How do we get our files to the server?

        It's easy! It's similar to dragging files from one folder to another. But instead, you'll be moving files from your computer to your server.
        <div class="img-wrapper">
        ![laptop](framework/img/workshop/noun_114_cc.svg)<!-- .element: class="laptop" -->
        ![folder](framework/img/workshop/noun_8930_cc.svg)<!-- .element: class="folder" --> ![servers](framework/img/workshop/noun_29558_cc.svg)<!-- .element: class="servers" -->
        </div>
        You'll need 3 things:
        
        * a domain name - your web address (e.g. mywebsite.com)
        * a server/host - web space for your files
        * an FTP client - to upload files to the server 
      </script>
    </section>
    
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Server vs Domain?
        
        A **server** is the computer that will "host" the folder with your files.
        
        The **domain** is the internet address used to access that folder on the server.
        
        Many hosting companies will also sell domains but you can also purchase these separately and connect them through your hosting provider.
        
        <br>
        There are many hosting and domain companies to choose from. Today we'll be using [Hover](http://hover.com) to register a domain.
        
        Hover has offered to reimburse every learner for up to $20 for a purchase made within 7 days of Hackapalooza! Please inform a member of Ladies Learning Code of the email address used during your signup to receive your reimbursement.
        
        See more about Hover [here](http://ladieslearningcode.com/getting-hosted-domains-with-hover/).

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ##Step 1

        Visit [hover.com](http://hover.com). 
        
        Select **Find a domain** and enter your desired domain name into the search box.

        ## Step 2
        A list of available domain name extensions will show as well as suggestions for similar names.  This is useful if your desired domain name is already taken.
        
        Select an option and add to cart.

        ## Step 3 (Optional)
        
        **Mail Forwards**  
        Forward your custom domain email address to your Gmail, Hotmail, etc.  Get the benefit of a custom email address without managing multiple accounts.
        
        **Small & Big Mailbox**  
        Ad-free email accounts. The Big option has more storage and a few other features.
        
        You can always add this option later. See full details [here](https://www.hover.com/email).  Email forwarding tutorials for specific devices and email providers are also included at the bottom of the page.

        ## Steps 4 & 5
        Create an account & add your WHOIS registration info.
        
        **What is a registration record?**
        
        When registering a domain name, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) requires your contact information for the WHOIS database which is publicly available using a WHOIS search tool. 
        
        Hover (and most other domain registrars) offer a privacy option, automatic with Hover's domain registration (see previous screenshot, the privacy option is automatically checked).  More info [here](https://help.hover.com/entries/21196313-Domain-WHOIS-Privacy).

        ## Step 6
        
        Add your billing info. 
        
        To add another domain name, just log into your new account, choose the **Add New** option and follow the same steps.

        ## Hosting with Google Drive
        
        There's many hosting companies to choose from and range in price. Let's first take a look at hosting with Google Drive, for free! Head over to [drive.google.com](http://drive.google.com) and login or create an account.  
        
        <!-- .element: class="footnote" -->**Important:**  
        Web hosting in Google Drive will be deprecated. You can continue to use this feature until **August 31st, 2016**.  
        After that, it will no longer work. More info [here](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2881970?hl=en).
        
        1. create a new folder to hold all your site’s files
        1. right-click / two-finger tap on the new folder to open the sharing settings
        
          ![](framework/img/workshop/google-drive-1.png)<!-- .element: style="margin-right:20px;" -->
          ![](framework/img/workshop/google-drive-2.png)
        1. then select the following options:
          * Get shareable link
          * Anyone on the internet can find and view
          * More
          * On - Public on the web

    </section>
    
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Hosting with Google Drive
        After your folder has been shared, upload your site files into the new folder you’ve just created.  Double click the folder to go into it.
        
        Upload your files by selecting **New > File upload** OR by dragging your files into the browser. Make sure your home page is named **index.html** because web servers will automatically map to this file.

    </section>
    
    <section class="slide drive-id" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Hosting with Google Drive
        
        Open your **Share** options again and copy your share link.  It should look something like this: 
        
        drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B-mFN_kIVO3nZUZfejBjaE96Ym8&usp=sharing <!-- .element: class="example" -->
        
        Now copy JUST the id value &mdash; which is everything between the `=` and `&` symbols.
        
        drive.google.com/folderview?id=<!-- .element: class="example" -->**0B-mFN_kIVO3nZUZfejBjaE96Ym8**&usp=sharing
        
        Append the id to the below url.
    
        www.googledrive.com/host/<!-- .element: class="example" -->
    
        Like so:
        
        www.googledrive.com/host/0B-mFN_kIVO3nZUZfejBjaE96Ym8<!-- .element: class="example" -->

        ## Domain Forwarding
        
        Great! Your site is live but who's going to remember `www.googledrive.com/host/0B-mFN_kIVO3nZUZfejBjaE96Ym8`?
        
        To setup domain forwarding, log into your domain provider and find a forwarding option.
        
        On Hover, this is found under **Your Account > Domains** (it is also the landing page when you log in).  If you have more than one domain, select the one to be forwarded to edit it.
        
        Find the **Forward this domain** option, select **Edit** and enter your Google Drive address.

        ##Paid Hosting
        
        Google Drive is a great free option but it's going to end soon! What other options are there?
        
        There are many hosting companies out there such as [A Small Orange](https://asmallorange.com) or [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com) to name a couple.  Ladies Learning Code uses [Dreamhost](http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?2085384).
        
        (Use coupon code **LLC40** to get $40 off your hosting registration!)
        
        <br>
        Uploading your web site files to any of these hosting companies will require using an FTP client.  Before we get to that, let's first go over how to point your domain to your hosting companie's server.

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Domains & Hosting
        
        Some hosting companies provide domain name services as well. If you have a domain with your hosting company, you can skip this step. To forward your domain to your hosting company, follow the steps below:
        
        First, find your hosting provider’s **nameservers**. It will look something like this:
        
        ```
        ns1.hostingcompany.com
        ns2.hostingcompany.com
        ```
          
        This info is provided by your hosting company but the website's interface for finding this info will vary. Sometimes it is also included in your confirmation email when you sign up.
        
        You could also contact customer support or just do a web search for "[your host] nameservers".  For example, searching for "Dreamhost nameservers" brings up [this page](http://wiki.dreamhost.com/Nameservers).  Dreamhost's nameservers are:
      
        ```
        ns1.dreamhost.com
        ns2.dreamhost.com
        ns3.dreamhost.com
        ```

        1. login to your Hover account
        1. go to **Your Account > Domains** (also the landing page when you log in)
        1. click your domain

        ## FTP (File Transfer Protocol)

        To use FTP, you will need to create an FTP username and password and download an FTP client which is software that allows you to connect to the server to upload files.
        
        To create an FTP user in Dreamhost, follow these steps. (This will be similar with other hosting companies).
        
        * go to **Users > Manage users > Add a new user **
        * create a username, password and save

        ## FTP Client
        
        To get your files online, you will need upload your files to your newly purchased hosting server. Be sure to have the below information.

        * FTP Address (usually ftp.yourdomain.com or just yourdomain.com - check with your hosting provider)
        * FTP Username
        * FTP Password
        
        There are many free FTP Clients.  A great one is [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org).
        
        Here's a tutorial to get your files online using FileZilla: [FileZilla Client Tutorial](https://wiki.filezilla-project.org/FileZilla_Client_Tutorial_%28en%29)
